# My Rubric for Evaluating Software Organizations

### Introduction
This is my attempt to put together a rubric for grading software engineering
organizations. These are competencies that I've noticed that I think are
important for organizations to get right in order to be successful. It's worth
noting that this list may be somewhat biased by my history of only being an
individual contributor (IC), and will probably evolve over time.

I've broken this into 4 broad categories - management, product, technical, and
compensation. While these categories may line up to departments or roles within
a company, I wouldn't say that the competencies in each category are solely
influenced by that role or department. As an example, process is a result of
collaboration between managers, product owners, and technical ICs (well it
should be at least), but here I'm making it an aspect of management. I've tried
to keep these competencies fairly independent as well, wouldn't want to knock an
org too many times for one thing, but obviously some things (like communication)
can have a lot of influence on others. I was tempted to try apply weights to
some of these competencies, but then I don't think I would have ever gotten this
finished. At this time I am trying to consider all of these items as equally
important. With this in mind, don't read too much into ordering here.

### Management

##### Communication - Information Transfer

I originally had communication as just one competency, but it feels too
important for that. I've broken it into two pieces, information transfer and
feedback. Communication, and especially this component of it - information
transfer, is something that can influence a lot of these other competencies.
Organizations are all about getting groups of people to work together, and
communication between people is the most fundamental need in order for that to
happen (the [story of the Tower of
Babel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tower_of_Babel) comes to mind).

What I'm thinking about when evaluating information transfer in an organization
is how effective and efficient is the flow of information throughout the
organization. Now there are two components here - effectiveness and efficiency.
Effective information transfer means that information gets to the right people
at the right time. Efficient information transfer means that the transfer is
targeted to just the people that need to receive it, and people that aren't
concerned with the information don't receive it. Optimizing solely for one of
these components often comes at the expense of the other. You could effectively
transfer your information by using the @channel tag in a Slack channel that the
whole company is in, but this would by no means be efficient. On the other hand,
efficient information transfer has to solve the hard problem of knowing which people in
the organization are interested in the information you have. Without mind
readers, an over optimization of efficiency will invariably end up excluding
some people that are interested in the information.

Organizations that are top notch at information transfer are going to be doing a
good job optimizing both the effectiveness and efficiency of their
communication.  People will receive relevant, useful information at a time when
it is actionable. A telltale sign of organizations that are not competent at
information transfer will be people receiving information too late for it to be
actionable, or not at all (ineffectiveness). It can also be the case that people
are exposed to too much information (inefficiency), and either ignore the
information they receive or waste an inordinate amount of their time trying to
parse through it to find things that are relevant to them.

Communication in an organization is something that has been written about
extensively, and by people much smarter than me. This is also something not
unique to software engineering organizations, all groups of human being face
this issue. Continually asking the question of how organizations can be more
effective and efficient with their communications is one of the best things a
company or team can do to be successful.

##### Communication - Feedback

##### Support

< do people receive the support/input they need from managers to get their jobs done >

##### Onboarding to the Company

< getting laptop, HR, benefits, etc. added to correct ldap group>

##### Career Development

##### Team Organization

< does the reporting hierarchy and ownership of components (is there ownership?) make sense? touch on Conways law and reverse conway maneuver>

##### Process

### Product

##### Vision

< is the business vision clearly defined and coherent >

##### Developer Input

< do developer have input on what is being built >

##### Measurement & Metrics

##### Culture

<lean product thinking, agile software development values held>

### Technical

##### Architecture

##### Code and Systems Quality

##### Onboarding to the System and Code Base

##### Developer Experience and Productivity

##### "Interesting" Problems

##### Excellence

< are the individuals in the org strong engineers, "dont be the smartest guy in the room", "A-team players want to play with other A-team players" >

##### Culture

< devops, agile software development values held, ci/cd principles >

### Compensation

##### Pay

< is the pay fair >

##### Benefits

##### Work/Life Balance
