Going to use this repository to store my writing on various technical subjects.

May get these essays hosted on a blog somewhere, sometime. But for now figured
it would just be best to get words in files while I have the time.

Including the outline I start with before writing, though the outline may not
be kept up to date. PRs, issues, and comments are welcome.

Ideas for future essays:
- A defense of the microservices architecture used on my last team
- Explore the relationships between agile, lean, devops, and continuous delivery
- How to build a CI/CD system for a team that's currently in the wild west
